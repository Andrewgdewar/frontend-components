# Communication

Platform Experience uses a few different ways to communicate and hold files

## Google Drive

* [Shared Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1rufYpwBIiXxbK-yJTRZfA_oNotU4Xkrr)
* [Demo Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1J2YWgOjNHGvM_s2oJ0pVFtDAoaPm47Bs)
* [UI Guild Meetings](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1OWIU24zjpHO4QdhGyGq-v4g23q0BSMAG)

## Messaging

We primarily use [CoreOS Slack](coreos.slack.com) for our messaging.

Some useful channels to join are:

* #team-consoledot-experience (team channel)
* #forum-consoledot-ui (UI based channel for all teams)
* #forum-consoledot (general channel for all teams)
* #consoledot-incident (channel for outage notifications)

If you’re part of the team, you’ll also be enrolled in the #team-consoledot-all channel

## Email Lists

* insights-platform@redhat.com
* insights-dev@redhat.com
* sd-org@redhat.com
