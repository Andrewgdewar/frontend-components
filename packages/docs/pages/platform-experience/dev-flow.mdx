# Developer Flow

## Git

We primarily use GitHub for all of our git based activities. There are also instances where we need to use GitLab (internal things).

* [Our GitHub org](https://github.com/redHatInsights/)
* [Our GitLab org](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/insights-platform)
* [QE GitLab](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/insights-qe/)

You should be enrolled in the #platform-experience team in GitHub which will give you write access to any repository that Platform Experience owns

### Repositories

These are all of the repositories that Platform Experience owns:

* [chrome](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-chrome)
* [frontend-components](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-components)
* [landing-page-frontend](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/landing-page-frontend)
* [insights-rbac-ui](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-rbac-ui)
* [access-requests-frontend](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/access-requests-frontend)
* [cloud-services-config](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/cloud-services-config)
* [frontend-starter-app](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-starter-app)
