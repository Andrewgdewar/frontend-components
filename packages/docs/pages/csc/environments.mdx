# Environments

## Branch links and syncing

These are the urls for each branch:

### Beta

* stage-beta: `https://console.stage.redhat.com/beta`
* prod-beta: `https://console.redhat.com/beta`
* qa-beta: `https://qaprodauth.console.redhat.com/beta`


### Stable

* stage: `https://console.stage.redhat.com`
* prod-stable: `https://console.redhat.com`
* qa-beta: `https://qaprodauth.console.redhat.com`

### Branch synchronization

* ci-beta -> qa-beta -> stage-beta
* ci-stable -> qa-stable -> stage-stable

## Adding Config for New Apps

To enable a new app in our environments, you need to create configuration for it in `main.yml` and in `/chrome` directory. After that create a PR to merge it into the `ci-beta` branch. The configuration for the non-prod beta branches is kept in sync. Changes to `ci-beta` will automatically be merged into `qa-beta` (as mentioned above).

When you need this config added to another environment (`ci-stable`, `prod-beta`, `prod-stable`), please open another PR for that environment. If you have any concerns about this process, feel free to ping #forum-clouddot-ui on Slack for assistance.
