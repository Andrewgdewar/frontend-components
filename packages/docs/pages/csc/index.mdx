# About

The <a href="https://github.com/RedHatInsights/cloud-services-config" target="__blank">cloud services config</a> repo deals with the high-level configuration of Cloud Services. `main.yml` contains the build assets source of truth apps. The `akamai` folder deals with updating our Akamai configuration. The `chrome` folder hosts UI specific configuration files.

## Build Process

This repository has a webhook that automatically builds a [Jenkins job](https://jenkins-jenkins.5a9f.insights-dev.openshiftapps.com/job/akamai-config-deployer/) on every push. To configure this webhook, check the project's [webhook settings](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/cloud-services-config/settings/hooks)

## Akamai API Access

Before you can run the property-updating script locally, you need to have access to the Akamai API.
To do this, follow the steps located [here](https://developer.akamai.com/api/getting-started). In step 5 of this doc the guide instructs you to set the Access Level of the Diagnostics Tools API to READ_WRITE; do this but also set the Access Level of the Property Manager API (PAPI) to READ-Write. Otherwise you will not have authorization to the configurations of Cloud Services. Make sure that the `.edgerc` file you create is located in your `home` directory and has the credentials defined in the `[default]` section of the file.
If you're able to run the sample call at the end of the doc, you should be able to run the script. If you run into issues, there may be something wrong with your `.edgerc` file.

For more information on the Akamai API, read the [property manager docs](https://developer.akamai.com/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html).

## Making changes to main.yml

Most of the config in `main.yml` is deprecated. The only required application attribute is the `deployment_repo`
