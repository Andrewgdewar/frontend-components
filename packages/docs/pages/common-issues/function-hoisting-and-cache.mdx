# Functions hoisting and cache

In some cases, it is beneficial to cache your function results. Some computations can be expensive or in the case of async functions, the execution depends on the network response. This is especially true when dealing with lazy loaded JS chunks.

Let's take a look at function caching, and to avoid stale or unexpected results of cached functions.

## Function cache (memoize)

Building a cache is a fairly simple and common concept. You take the function input, execute it, store the result and next time the result is taken from the cache instead of executing the function again.

<ExampleComponent source="functionsHoistingCache/functionCache.js" name="Basic example" />

The example above demonstrates the cache. The inner function is only called if it receives new arguments. The calls are demonstrated by the counter. It is only incremented when a new value is added to the text input.

## Problem - cache is persisting in different components

**The cache is tied to the function instance**. This is very important to remember. There might be cases in which you think your function should run again, but it does not and it returns "invalid" value. See the following example. Try typing **foo** into both fields:

<ExampleComponent source="functionsHoistingCache/invalidReturnValue.js" name="Persistent cache example" />

In short, the async validation should return an error if a value was added to either of the fields in the past. but because the validator is cached, it does not check the persistent storage (might be database in real world) when tying to the second input.

That is because the function was memoized on top of the JS file. The memoized function has a global scope and will not create a new cache instance per field!

To get around that, each field must have its cache instance.

## Solution - have a unique cache per component

When creating memoized function, make sure to create it at instance scope, not global scope.  Try typing **foo** into both fields:

<ExampleComponent source="functionsHoistingCache/validReturnValue.js" name="Persistent unique cache example" />

## How does this apply in a real situation?

### Common example

If you need to memoize functions, never do it on global scope, make sure the scope is always local.

```jsx

import memoize from '/some/memoize/function';

const myFunction = (...args) => {
  // do something
  return someResult
}

// this is wrong!
const memoizedFunction = memoize(myFunction)

// this is good
// the getter will create new cache each time it is called
const getMemoizedFunction = () => memoize(myFunction)

```

### DDF example

In DDF custom validators are always cached, including async functions. If you define them in your schema, and schema is defined statically, the cache will be persistent and it will be shared across all forms.

```jsx
import validate from 'path/to/validate'

const schema = {
  fields: [{
    name: 'first-name',
    label: 'First name',
    // this is wrong, cache will be shared globally!
    validate: [validate]
  }]
}

```

Sometimes anonymous functions can help, but only if the schema variable is also re-created

```jsx
import validate from 'path/to/validate'

const schema = {
  fields: [{
    name: 'first-name',
    label: 'First name',
    // this is wrong, cache is still shared by all instances of this form!
    validate: [(..args) => validate(...args)]
  }]
}

```

The optimal solution is to both use anonymous functions and return the schema from a function

```jsx
import validate from 'path/to/validate'

const getSchema = () => {
  fields: [{
    name: 'first-name',
    label: 'First name',
    // this is correct, cache is always bound to the field and form instances
    validate: [(..args) => validate(...args)]
  }]
}

```
