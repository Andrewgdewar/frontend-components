# RedHat Cloud Services frontend components - webpack config

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40redhat-cloud-services%2Ffrontend-components-config.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40redhat-cloud-services%2Ffrontend-components-config)

## Webpack 5

In order to use the new version of webpack and its federated medules you'll have to change your run script to use new [`webpack serve`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/).
```JS
> webpack-dev-server -> webpack serve
```

You'll also have to update your `webpack-cli` dependency to `>=4.2.0`, this package has `peerDependency` on it so you should see warning in your console.

### Removed features with webpack 5

The new version of webpack 5 changed plyfills and plugin configs, some packages are outdated, one example is `lodash-webpack-plugin` this plugin is no longer maintain anyways. You should be just fine by installing `lodash` directly, imports can stay the same as before `import get from 'lodash/get`.
